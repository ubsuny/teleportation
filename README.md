# QUANTUM TELEPORTATION
This project will give a basic idea of what is  Quantum Teleportation and how does it work. We will also use IBM Qiskit to simulate the teleportatio process and than run it in real quantum computer to comare the result with our predcition (simulation) in GUI. We will also use Jupyter Notebook to repeat the process wihtout GUI. We will use the algorithm(Quantum circuit) , codes or examples  mostly from IBM Qistkit\Teleportation  for demonstration. Other sources are mentioned in refference section. 


# Method 
 In this project, we will use Quantum computer to teleport the state of one quit from one persons qubit to another without moving the qubit. 
 Based on the theories, we will implement the idea of EPR / Bell pairs to create entangled states of qubits and then applying protocol we would be able to re create the state . We will use IBM Qiskit for simulation and run it in real Quantum Computer. We will also use Jupyter Notebok to do the same without GUI.  This Project will be saved in a github repository (github/teleportation) for future change /updates ) 

# Prrocess:
In Jupyter Notebook we will do the following:\
> Using Qiskit  we will  design Quantum Algorithm (circuit) using Quantum Teleportation Protocol.\
> In qiskit Aer simulator we will run the simulation and test our circuit.\
> Finally we will execute our Teleportation Circuit in  Quantum Computer using qiskit.


# RESULTS 
> Quantum Teleportation Circuit created succesfuuly.\
> Simulation agrees with the prdiction\
> The probability outcome from uantum Computer execution agrees with the prediction.

#Outlook 
>Docstring were implemented where new function was defined.\
> Linting was completed with pycodestyle module.
